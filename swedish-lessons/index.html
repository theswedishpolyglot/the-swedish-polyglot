        <h1>Why should I book lessons with The Swedish Polyglot?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Your teacher has language <u>learning</u> expertise:</strong> your teacher has himself, since 2016, learned multiple languages to an intermediate level or higher (including for example Spanish, German and Japanese) and spends over 2 000 hours per year studying languages himself (reading, listening etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Your teacher has given over 3 300 lessons to more than 700 students:</strong> with an average rating of 5 out of 5.</li>
          <li><strong>After each lesson you receive a flashcard deck and and audio file containing all sentences:</strong> to reinforce the new reading, listening and speaking vocabulary (as well as grammar and pronunciation).</li>
          <li><strong>You receive premium learning materials for self-study between lessons:</strong> your teacher has spent hundreds of hours making high-quality digital flashcard decks for his students that target reading vocabulary, speaking vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. As a package student you recieve access to this material. </li>

      <section class="content" id="why-not">
        <h1>Reasons for not booking lessons with The Swedish Polyglot</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You expect traditional teaching methods:</strong> your teacher has a background in psychology (licenced psychologist) and <u>language learning</u>, and does not come from a traditional teaching background. Your teacher will teach you Swedish based on how languages are learned and not based on how they are traditionally taught.</li>
        </ul>
