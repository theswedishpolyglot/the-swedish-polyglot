                    William Matkaselkä started learning languages in 2016 and has been hooked ever since. 
                    Today his repertoire of languages span three language groups and include Swedish, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin and Vietnamese.
                </p>
                <p>In his pursuit of higher levels of comprehension in these languages, he has developed an interest in psychology and technology as means to becoming more effective.</p>
                <p>Since 2023 he holds a master's degree in psychology from Linköping University and he is currently pursuing a degree in software engineering in his free time.</p>
                <p>
                    He has been teaching language learning methodology and specific languages such as Swedish, English and Spanish since 2018. 
                    He has now taught over 2 800 lessons to more than 600 students in over 50 countries.
                </p>
                <p>He is currently involved in several projects meant to advance the activities of language learning and second-language acquisition:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He is writing a book with the working title <i>Language Learning From First Principles</i>. It currently spans over 100 000 words and 400 pages. He has written an average of 500 words or 2 paragraphs per day.</li>
                    <li>
                        He is developing language learning software that automates the creation of large, effective and compelling flashcard decks. 
                        He is currently selling the products of this software through his <a href="https://www.italki.com/TheSwedishPolyglot">teacher profile</a> as well as on his website. 
                        The software will be available as one or more services or applications in the future. He has written 10 000 lines of code in the first 6 months of development.
